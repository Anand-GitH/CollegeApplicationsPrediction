# CollegeApplicationsPrediction
Predictive Models to predict number of applications recieved

Dataset: College Data Set in ISLR

-Understanding the data - Exploratory Analysis
-Preparing data - training and test data 
-Modelling data - different algorithms are used for the building predictive model
Linear Regression,Ridge Regression,LASSO,PCR and PLS
-Evaluating models using MSE and choosing best model for predicting the number of applications recieved.

LASSO and PLS performed well for the given dataset with prediction error MSE as 0.11 and 0.12.
Acceptance rate,expenses,top10percent has more important predictors in predicting the number of applications recieved.
